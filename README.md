Bridge from web2 to web3, from DNS to IPFS. from .my to .space and beyond.

# Notes / Problem Statement

.MY is a mostly unknown extension. Despite the fac thtat it should be more known... "my" denotes a possessive sense, like "me.". 
Then again, most people think .ME is for just "ME", not Montenegro, so why should they know .MY is from Malaysia?
And yes, .AI is Anguilla.
